The home page content showcases information about their new
products. The page structure includes a header with the shop name,
the shop logo positioned in the upper right corner, and navigation
buttons to access each page, which remain visible while scrolling. The
page also features a "BREAKING NEWS" section as the title, followed
by subheadings and descriptions. The content is structured as
follows: the first section displays an image on the left side with a
description and a link on the right side, while the next section follows
the opposite arrangement. The buttons in the content are interactive,
changing color when hovered over and responding to clicks.

The content of the form page consists of a sign-up form. The header
structure remains the same, including the navigation button. The form is
titled 'SIGN UP' and includes fields for Name, E-mail, Age, Password, and
Re-input Password, which are required for user registration. Users can
input their name and email, and for the age field, they can either input a
value or use an arrow to adjust the number, as shown below. The
password input is visually encrypted, displaying '*' characters, as is the reinput password field. The submit button is hoverable, changing color when hovered over, and clickable. Additionally, there is a clickable link to
the log-in page.

The additional page, which is the contact page, showcases the shop's
social media presence. The header structure and navigation buttons
remain the same. The content of the page consists of social media
blocks, which change color when hovered over, reflecting the color
of the respective platform's logo. Each block displays the account
name for each platform and is clickable, leading to their respective websites. For example, clicking on the YouTube social media block will direct users to the website "https://www.youtube.com/".
